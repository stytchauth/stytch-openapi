        The new email address must meet the following requirements:


        - Must not be in use by another member (retired emails count as used until
        they are [unlinked](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/unlink-retired-member-email))

        - Must not be updating for another member (i.e. two members cannot attempt
        to update to the same email at once)


        The member will receive an Email Magic Link that expires in 5 minutes. If
        they do not verify their new email address in that timeframe, the email

        will be freed up for other members to use.


        The Magic Link will redirect to your `login_redirect_url` (or the configured
        default if one isn''t provided), and you should invoke the [Authenticate Magic
        Link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link) endpoint as

        This endpoint validates various fields (`scope`, `client_id`, `redirect_uri`,
        `prompt`, etc...) are correct and returns

        relevant information for rendering an OAuth Consent Screen.


        This endpoint returns:

        - A public representation of the Connected App requesting authorization

        - Whether _explicit_ consent must be granted before proceeding with the authorization

        - A list of scopes the Member has the ability to grant the Connected App


        Use this response to prompt the Member for consent (if necessary) before calling
        the [Submit OAuth Authorization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-apps-oauth-authorize)
        endpoint.


        Exactly one of the following must be provided to identify the Member granting
        authorization:

        - `organization_id` + `member_id`

        - `session_token`

        - `session_jwt`


        If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed, the OAuth Authorization will
        be linked to the Member''s session for tracking purposes.

        One of these fields must be used if the Connected App intends to complete
        the [Exchange Access Token](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-app-access-token-exchange)

        [Preflight Check](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-apps-oauth-authorize-start)

        Note that this endpoint takes in a few additional parameters the preflight
        check does not- `state`, `nonce`, and `code_challenge`.


        If the authorization was successful, the `redirect_uri` will contain a valid
        `authorization_code` embedded as a query parameter.

        If the authorization was unsuccessful, the `redirect_uri` will contain an
        OAuth2.1 `error_code`.

        Within the JWKS, the JSON Web Keys are rotated every ~6 months. Upon rotation,
        new JWTs will be signed using the new key, and both keys will be returned
        by this endpoint for a period of 1 month.


        JWTs have a set lifetime of 5 minutes, so there will be a 5 minute period
        where some JWTs will be signed by the old keys, and some JWTs will be signed
        by the new keys. The correct key to use for validation is determined by matching
        the `kid` value of the JWT and key.


        If you''re using one of our [backend SDKs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks),
        the JSON Web Key (JWK) rotation will be handled for you.


        If you''re using your own JWT validation library, many have built-in support
        for JWK rotation, and you''ll just need to supply this API endpoint. If not,
        your application should decide which JWK to use for validation by inspecting
        the `kid` value.

      description: 'Use this endpoint to exchange a Member''s existing session for
        another session in a different Organization. This can be used to accept an
        invite, but not to create a new member via domain matching.


        To create a new member via email domain JIT Provisioning, use the [Exchange
        Intermediate Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
        flow instead.


        If the user **has** already satisfied the authentication requirements of the
        Organization they are trying to switch into, this API will return `member_authenticated:
        true` and a `session_token` and `session_jwt`.


        If the user **has not** satisfied the primary or secondary authentication
        requirements of the Organization they are attempting to switch into, this
        API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token`.


        If `primary_required` is set, prompt the user to fulfill the Organization''s
        auth requirements using the options returned in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods`.


        If `primary_required` is null and `mfa_required` is set, check `mfa_required.member_options`
        to determine if the Member has SMS OTP or TOTP set up for MFA and prompt accordingly.
        If the Member has SMS OTP, check `mfa_required.secondary_auth_initiated` to
        see if the OTP has already been sent.


        Include the `intermediate_session_token` returned above when calling the `authenticate()`
        method that the user needed to perform. Once the user has completed the authentication
        requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token`
        and `session_jwt` to indicate they have successfully logged into the Organization.


        The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate
        Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
        or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery)
        to join a different Organization or create a new one.

        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will
        be ignored.'

        by this endpoint for a period of 1 month.


        JWTs have a set lifetime of 5 minutes, so there will be a 5 minute period
        where some JWTs will be signed by the old keys, and some JWTs will be signed
        by the new keys. The correct key to use for validation is determined by matching
        the `kid` value of the JWT and key.


        If you''re using one of our [backend SDKs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks),
        the JSON Web Key (JWK) rotation will be handled for you.


        If you''re using your own JWT validation library, many have built-in support
        for JWK rotation, and you''ll just need to supply this API endpoint. If not,
        your application should decide which JWK to use for validation by inspecting

        that the user wishes to log into.


        This endpoint can be used to accept invites and JIT Provision into a new Organization
        on the basis of the user''s email domain or OAuth tenant.


        If the user **has** already satisfied the authentication requirements of the
        Organization they are trying to exchange into and logged in with a method
        that verifies their email address, this API will return `member_authenticated:
        true` and a `session_token` and `session_jwt`.


        If the user **has not** satisfied the primary or secondary authentication
        requirements of the Organization they are attempting to exchange into or is
        JIT Provisioning but did not log in via a method that provides email verification,
        this API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token`.


        If `primary_required` is returned, prompt the user to fulfill the Organization''s
        auth requirements using the options returned in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods`.


        If `primary_required` is null and `mfa_required` is set, check `mfa_required.member_options`
        to determine if the Member has SMS OTP or TOTP set up for MFA and prompt accordingly.
        If the Member has SMS OTP, check `mfa_required.secondary_auth_initiated` to
        see if the OTP has already been sent.


        Include the `intermediate_session_token` returned above when calling the `authenticate()`
        method that the user needed to perform. Once the user has completed the authentication
        requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token`
        and `session_jwt` to indicate they have successfully logged into the Organization.


        The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Create Organization
        via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery)
        to create a new Organization instead of joining an existing one.'

        You can make a decision based on the recommended `verdict` in the response:

        * `ALLOW` - This is a known valid device grouping or device profile that is
        part of the default `ALLOW` listed set of known devices by Stytch. This grouping
        is made up of  verified device profiles that match the characteristics of
        known/authentic traffic origins.

        * `BLOCK` - This is a known bad or malicious device profile that is undesirable
        and should be blocked from completing the privileged action in question.

        * `CHALLENGE` - This is an unknown or potentially malicious device that should
        be put through increased friction such as 2FA or other forms of extended user
        verification before allowing the privileged action to proceed.


        If the `telemetry_id` is expired or not found, this endpoint returns a 404
        `telemetry_id_not_found` [error](https://stytch.com/docs/fraud/api/errors/404#telemetry_id_not_found).

        We recommend treating 404 errors as a `BLOCK`, since it could be a sign of
        an attacker trying to bypass DFP protections.

      description: 'Set a rule for a particular `visitor_id`, `browser_id`, `visitor_fingerprint`,
        `browser_fingerprint`, `hardware_fingerprint`, `network_fingerprint`, `cidr_block`,
        `asn`, or `country_code`. This is helpful in cases where you want to allow
        or block a specific user or fingerprint. You should be careful when setting
        rules for `browser_fingerprint`, `hardware_fingerprint`, or `network_fingerprint`
        as they can be shared across multiple users, and you could affect more users
        than intended.


        You may not set an `ALLOW` rule for a `country_code`.


        Rules are applied in the order specified above. For example, if an end user
        has an `ALLOW` rule set for their `visitor_id` but a `BLOCK` rule set for
        their `hardware_fingerprint`, they will receive an `ALLOW` verdict because
        the `visitor_id` rule takes precedence.


        If there are conflicts between multiple `cidr_block` rules (for example, if
        the `ip_address` of the end user overlaps with multiple CIDR blocks that have
        rules set), the conflicts are resolved as follows:

        - The smallest block size takes precedence. For example, if an `ip_address`
        overlaps with a `cidr_block` rule of `ALLOW` for a block with a prefix of
        `/32` and a `cidr_block` rule of `BLOCK` with a prefix of `/24`, the rule
        match verdict will be `ALLOW`.

        - Among equivalent size blocks, `BLOCK` takes precedence over `CHALLENGE`,
        which takes precedence over `ALLOW`. For example, if an `ip_address` overlaps
        with two `cidr_block` rules with blocks of the same size that return `CHALLENGE`
        and `ALLOW`, the rule match verdict will be `CHALLENGE`.'

        They can be used to complete an MFA requirement, or they can be used as a

        This endpoint verifies that the one-time passcode (OTP) is valid and hasn''t
        expired or been previously used. OTP codes expire after two minutes.


        A given Member may only have a single active OTP code at any given time. If
        a Member requests another OTP code before the first one has expired, the first
        one will be invalidated.


        Exactly one of `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`
        must be provided in the request.

        If an intermediate session token is provided, this operation will consume
        it.


        Intermediate session tokens are generated upon successful calls to primary
        authenticate methods in the case where MFA is required,

        such as [email magic link authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link),

        or upon successful calls to discovery authenticate methods, such as [email
        magic link discovery authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-discovery-magic-link).


        If the Organization''s MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, a successful OTP

        ### Cost to send SMS OTP

        Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch [bills the
        costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how
        to protect your app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).


        __Note:__ SMS to phone numbers outside of the US and Canada is disabled by
        default for customers who did not use SMS prior to October 2023. If you''re
        interested in sending international SMS, please add those countries to your
        Project''s allowlist via the [Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/country-code-allowlists)
        or [Programmatic Workspace Actions](https://stytch.com/docs/workspace-management/pwa/set-allowed-country-codes),
        and [add credit card details](https://stytch.com/dashboard/settings/billing)
        to your account.


        Even when international SMS is enabled, we do not support sending SMS to countries
        on our [Unsupported countries list](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/unsupported-countries).


        ### Add a phone number to an existing user


        This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch
        User. Including a `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send
        one-time passcode by SMS request will add the new, unverified phone number
        to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates within
        5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently
        on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object,
        and any subsequent login requests using that phone number will create a new
        User.
