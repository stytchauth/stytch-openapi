      description: 'Starts a self-serve email update for a Member specified by their
        `organization_id` and `member_id`.

        To perform a self-serve update, members must be active and have an active,
        verified email address.


        The new email address must meet the following requirements:


        - Must not be in use by another member (retired emails count as used until
        they are [unlinked](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/unlink-retired-member-email))

        - Must not be updating for another member (i.e. two members cannot attempt
        to update to the same email at once)


        The member will receive an Email Magic Link (or Email OTP Code, if `EMAIL_OTP`
        is specified as the delivery method) that expires in 5 minutes. If they do
        not verify their new email address in that timeframe, the email

        will be freed up for other members to use.


        If using Email Magic Links, the magic link will redirect to your `login_redirect_url`
        (or the configured default if one isn''t provided), and you should invoke
        the [Authenticate Magic Link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link)
        endpoint as normal to complete the flow.


        If using Email OTP Codes, you should invoke the [Authenticate Email OTP Code](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-email-otp)

        `prompt`, etc...) are correct and returns

        relevant information for rendering an OAuth Consent Screen.


        This endpoint returns:

        - A public representation of the Connected App requesting authorization

        - Whether _explicit_ consent must be granted before proceeding with the authorization

        - A list of scopes the Member has the ability to grant the Connected App

        the [Submit OAuth Authorization](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/connected-apps-oauth-authorize)

        Exactly one of the following must be provided to identify the Member granting
        authorization:

        - `organization_id` + `member_id`

        - `session_token`

        - `session_jwt`


        If a `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed, the OAuth Authorization will
        be linked to the Member''s session for tracking purposes.

        One of these fields must be used if the Connected App intends to complete

        issues may occur, as search performance may vary from ~150 milliseconds to
        9 seconds depending on query complexity and rate limits are set to 150 requests/minute.


        Search for Users within your Stytch Project.


        Use the `query` object to filter by different fields. See the `query.operands.filter_value`
        documentation below for a list of available filters.


        ### Export all User data


        Submit an empty `query` in your Search Users request to return all of your
        Stytch Project''s Users.

      description: 'Get the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for a project.


        Within the JWKS, the JSON Web Keys are rotated every ~6 months. Upon rotation,
        new JWTs will be signed using the new key, and both keys will be returned
        by this endpoint for a period of 1 month.


        JWTs have a set lifetime of 5 minutes, so there will be a 5 minute period
        where some JWTs will be signed by the old keys, and some JWTs will be signed
        by the new keys. The correct key to use for validation is determined by matching
        the `kid` value of the JWT and key.


        If you''re using one of our [backend SDKs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks),
        the JSON Web Key (JWK) rotation will be handled for you.


        If you''re using your own JWT validation library, many have built-in support
        for JWK rotation, and you''ll just need to supply this API endpoint. If not,
        your application should decide which JWK to use for validation by inspecting
        the `kid` value.


        See our [How to use Stytch Session JWTs](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/sessions/using-jwts)
        guide for more information.'

        a Session will not be extended. This endpoint requires either a `session_jwt`
        or `session_token` be included in the request. It will return an error if
        both are present.


        You may provide a JWT that needs to be refreshed and is expired according
        to its `exp` claim. A new JWT will be returned if both the signature and the
        underlying Session are still valid. See our [How to use Stytch Session JWTs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/sessions/resources/using-jwts)
        guide for more information.


        If an `authorization_check` object is passed in, this method will also check
        if the Member is authorized to perform the given action on the given Resource
        in the specified Organization. A Member is authorized if their Member Session
        contains a Role, assigned [explicitly or implicitly](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/rbac/role-assignment),
        with adequate permissions.

        In addition, the `organization_id` passed in the authorization check must
        match the Member''s Organization.


        If the Member is not authorized to perform the specified action on the specified
        Resource, or if the

        `organization_id` does not match the Member''s Organization, a 403 error will
        be thrown.

        Otherwise, the response will contain a list of Roles that satisfied the authorization
        check.'

      description: 'Use this endpoint to exchange a Member''s existing session for
        another session in a different Organization. This can be used to accept an
        invite, but not to create a new member via domain matching.


        To create a new member via email domain JIT Provisioning, use the [Exchange
        Intermediate Session](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
        flow instead.


        If the user **has** already satisfied the authentication requirements of the
        Organization they are trying to switch into, this API will return `member_authenticated:
        true` and a `session_token` and `session_jwt`.


        If the user **has not** satisfied the primary or secondary authentication
        requirements of the Organization they are attempting to switch into, this
        API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token`.


        If `primary_required` is set, prompt the user to fulfill the Organization''s
        auth requirements using the options returned in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods`.


        If `primary_required` is null and `mfa_required` is set, check `mfa_required.member_options`
        to determine if the Member has SMS OTP or TOTP set up for MFA and prompt accordingly.
        If the Member has SMS OTP, check `mfa_required.secondary_auth_initiated` to
        see if the OTP has already been sent.


        Include the `intermediate_session_token` returned above when calling the `authenticate()`
        method that the user needed to perform. Once the user has completed the authentication
        requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token`
        and `session_jwt` to indicate they have successfully logged into the Organization.


        The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate
        Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
        or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery)
        to join a different Organization or create a new one.

        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will
        be ignored.'

      description: 'Get the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) for a project.


        Within the JWKS, the JSON Web Keys are rotated every ~6 months. Upon rotation,
        new JWTs will be signed using the new key, and both keys will be returned
        by this endpoint for a period of 1 month.


        JWTs have a set lifetime of 5 minutes, so there will be a 5 minute period
        where some JWTs will be signed by the old keys, and some JWTs will be signed
        by the new keys. The correct key to use for validation is determined by matching
        the `kid` value of the JWT and key.


        If you''re using one of our [backend SDKs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/sdks),
        the JSON Web Key (JWK) rotation will be handled for you.


        If you''re using your own JWT validation library, many have built-in support
        for JWK rotation, and you''ll just need to supply this API endpoint. If not,
        your application should decide which JWK to use for validation by inspecting
        the `kid` value.


        See our [How to use Stytch Session JWTs](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/sessions/resources/using-jwts)

      description: 'Set the RBAC Policy for a specific Organization within your Stytch
        Project. An Organization RBAC Policy allows you to define roles that are specific
        to that organization, providing fine-grained control over permissions at the
        organization level.


        This endpoint allows you to create, update, or replace the organization-scoped
        roles for a given organization. Organization policies supplement the project-level
        RBAC policy with additional roles that are only applicable within the context
        of that specific organization.


        The organization policy consists of roles, where each role defines:

        - A unique `role_id` to identify the role

        - A human-readable `description` of the role''s purpose

        - A set of `permissions` that specify which actions can be performed on which
        resources


        When you set an organization policy, it will replace any existing organization-specific
        roles for that organization. The project-level RBAC policy remains unchanged.


        Organization-specific roles are useful for scenarios where different organizations
        within your project require different permission structures, such as:

        - Multi-tenant applications with varying access levels per tenant

        - Organizations with custom approval workflows

        - Different organizational hierarchies requiring unique role definitions

      description: 'Get the active RBAC Policy for your current Stytch Project. An
        RBAC Policy is the canonical document that stores all defined Resources and
        Roles within your RBAC permissioning model.


        When using the backend SDKs, the RBAC Policy will be cached to allow for local
        evaluations, eliminating the need for an extra request to Stytch.

        The policy will be refreshed if an authorization check is requested and the
        RBAC policy was last updated more than 5 minutes ago.


        Resources and Roles can be created and managed within the [RBAC page](https://stytch.com/dashboard/rbac)
        in the Dashboard.

        Additionally, [Role assignment](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/rbac/role-assignment)
        can be programmatically managed through certain Stytch API endpoints.

        that the user wishes to log into.


        This endpoint can be used to accept invites and JIT Provision into a new Organization
        on the basis of the user''s email domain or OAuth tenant.


        If the user **has** already satisfied the authentication requirements of the
        Organization they are trying to exchange into and logged in with a method
        that verifies their email address, this API will return `member_authenticated:
        true` and a `session_token` and `session_jwt`.


        If the user **has not** satisfied the primary or secondary authentication
        requirements of the Organization they are attempting to exchange into or is
        JIT Provisioning but did not log in via a method that provides email verification,
        this API will return `member_authenticated: false` and an `intermediate_session_token`.


        If `primary_required` is returned, prompt the user to fulfill the Organization''s
        auth requirements using the options returned in `primary_required.allowed_auth_methods`.


        If `primary_required` is null and `mfa_required` is set, check `mfa_required.member_options`
        to determine if the Member has SMS OTP or TOTP set up for MFA and prompt accordingly.
        If the Member has SMS OTP, check `mfa_required.secondary_auth_initiated` to
        see if the OTP has already been sent.


        Include the `intermediate_session_token` returned above when calling the `authenticate()`
        method that the user needed to perform. Once the user has completed the authentication
        requirements they were missing, they will be granted a full `session_token`
        and `session_jwt` to indicate they have successfully logged into the Organization.


        The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Create Organization
        via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery)
        to create a new Organization instead of joining an existing one.'

        You can make a decision based on the recommended `verdict` in the response:

        * `ALLOW` - This is a known valid device grouping or device profile that is
        part of the default `ALLOW` listed set of known devices by Stytch. This grouping
        is made up of  verified device profiles that match the characteristics of
        known/authentic traffic origins.

        * `BLOCK` - This is a known bad or malicious device profile that is undesirable
        and should be blocked from completing the privileged action in question.

        * `CHALLENGE` - This is an unknown or potentially malicious device that should
        be put through increased friction such as 2FA or other forms of extended user
        verification before allowing the privileged action to proceed.


        If the `telemetry_id` is expired or not found, this endpoint returns a 404
        `telemetry_id_not_found` [error](https://stytch.com/docs/fraud/api/errors/404#telemetry_id_not_found).

        We recommend treating 404 errors as a `BLOCK`, since it could be a sign of
        an attacker trying to bypass DFP protections.

        See [Attacker-controlled telemetry IDs](https://stytch.com/docs/fraud/guides/device-fingerprinting/integration-steps/test-your-integration#attacker-controlled-telemetry-ids)

      description: 'Set a rule for a particular `visitor_id`, `browser_id`, `visitor_fingerprint`,
        `browser_fingerprint`, `hardware_fingerprint`, `network_fingerprint`, `cidr_block`,
        `asn`, or `country_code`. This is helpful in cases where you want to allow
        or block a specific user or fingerprint. You should be careful when setting
        rules for `browser_fingerprint`, `hardware_fingerprint`, or `network_fingerprint`
        as they can be shared across multiple users, and you could affect more users
        than intended.


        You may not set an `ALLOW` rule for a `country_code`.


        Rules are applied in the order specified above. For example, if an end user
        has an `ALLOW` rule set for their `visitor_id` but a `BLOCK` rule set for
        their `hardware_fingerprint`, they will receive an `ALLOW` verdict because
        the `visitor_id` rule takes precedence.


        If there are conflicts between multiple `cidr_block` rules (for example, if
        the `ip_address` of the end user overlaps with multiple CIDR blocks that have
        rules set), the conflicts are resolved as follows:

        - The smallest block size takes precedence. For example, if an `ip_address`
        overlaps with a `cidr_block` rule of `ALLOW` for a block with a prefix of
        `/32` and a `cidr_block` rule of `BLOCK` with a prefix of `/24`, the rule
        match verdict will be `ALLOW`.

        - Among equivalent size blocks, `BLOCK` takes precedence over `CHALLENGE`,
        which takes precedence over `ALLOW`. For example, if an `ip_address` overlaps
        with two `cidr_block` rules with blocks of the same size that return `CHALLENGE`
        and `ALLOW`, the rule match verdict will be `CHALLENGE`.'

      description: 'Authenticate an impersonation token to impersonate a User. This
        endpoint requires an impersonation token that is not expired or previously
        used.

        A Stytch session will be created for the impersonated user with a 60 minute
        duration. Impersonated sessions cannot be extended.


        Prior to this step, you can generate an impersonation token by visiting the
        Stytch Dashboard, viewing a user, and clicking the `Impersonate User` button.'

        in a secure location. If the `next_client_secret` is lost, you will need to

        on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object,
        and any subsequent login requests using that email address will create a new
        User.

        that the member completed the OAuth flow by verifying that the token is valid

        set the lifetime of the session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter
        is not specified, a Stytch session will be created with a 60 minute duration.


        If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the
        returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token`
        will be returned.

        The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate
        endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete
        the MFA step and acquire a full member session.

        The `intermediate_session_token` can also be used with the [Exchange Intermediate
        Session endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/exchange-intermediate-session)
        or the [Create Organization via Discovery endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/create-organization-via-discovery)
        to join a different Organization or create a new one.

        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will
        be ignored.


        If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will
        not be required to complete an MFA step.


        If the Member is logging in via an OAuth provider that does not fully verify
        the email, the returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and
        an `intermediate_session_token` will be returned.

        The `primary_required` field details the authentication flow the Member must
        perform in order to [complete a step-up authentication](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/oauth/auth-flows)
        into the organization. The `intermediate_session_token` must be passed into
        that authentication flow.

        \ phone number and the provided `mfa_phone_number` does not match the existing\
        \ one.\n\nOTP codes expire after two minutes. Note that sending another OTP\
        \ code before the first has expired will invalidate the first code.\n\nIf\
        \ a Member has a phone number and is enrolled in MFA, then after a successful\
        \ primary authentication event (e.g. [email magic link](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link)\

        \ such as prompting a Member for an OTP again after a period of inactivity.\n\
        \nIf the Member already has an active MFA factor, then passing an intermediate\
        \ session token, session token, or session JWT with the existing MFA factor\
        \ on it is required to prevent bypassing MFA.  \n\nOtherwise, passing an intermediate\
        \ session token, session token, or session JWT is not required, but if passed\

      description: 'SMS OTPs may not be used as a primary authentication mechanism.
        They can be used to complete an MFA requirement, or they can be used as a
        step-up factor to be added to an existing session.


        This endpoint verifies that the one-time passcode (OTP) is valid and hasn''t
        expired or been previously used. OTP codes expire after two minutes.


        A given Member may only have a single active OTP code at any given time. If
        a Member requests another OTP code before the first one has expired, the first
        one will be invalidated.


        Exactly one of `intermediate_session_token`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt`
        must be provided in the request.

        If an intermediate session token is provided, this operation will consume
        it.


        Intermediate session tokens are generated upon successful calls to primary
        authenticate methods in the case where MFA is required,

        such as [email magic link authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-magic-link),

        or upon successful calls to discovery authenticate methods, such as [email
        magic link discovery authenticate](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-discovery-magic-link).


        If the Organization''s MFA policy is `REQUIRED_FOR_ALL`, a successful OTP
        authentication will change the Member''s `mfa_enrolled` status to `true` if
        it is not already `true`.

        If the Organization''s MFA policy is `OPTIONAL`, the Member''s MFA enrollment
        can be toggled by passing in a value for the `set_mfa_enrollment` field.

        The Member''s MFA enrollment can also be toggled through the [Update Member](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/update-member)
        endpoint.


        Provide the `session_duration_minutes` parameter to set the lifetime of the
        session. If the `session_duration_minutes` parameter is not specified, a Stytch
        session will be created with a duration of 60 minutes.'

        If a user with this email already exists in your Stytch project, this endpoint
        will return a `duplicate_email` error. To add a password to an existing passwordless
        user, you''ll need to either call the [Migrate password endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/api/password-migrate)
        or prompt the user to complete one of our password reset flows.


        This endpoint will return an error if the password provided does not meet
        our strength requirements, which you can check beforehand via the [Password
        strength check endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/api/password-strength-check).


        When creating new Passwords users, it''s good practice to enforce an email
        verification flow. We''d recommend checking out our [Email verification guide](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/email-verification/overview)
        for more information.'

      description: 'Authenticate a member with their email address and password. This
        endpoint verifies that the member has a password currently set, and that the
        entered password is correct.


        If you have breach detection during authentication enabled in your [password
        strength policy](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/passwords/strength-policy)
        and the member''s credentials have appeared in the HaveIBeenPwned dataset,
        this endpoint will return a `member_reset_password` error even if the member
        enters a correct password. We force a password reset in this case to ensure
        that the member is the legitimate owner of the email address and not a malicious
        actor abusing the compromised credentials.


        If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the
        returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token`
        will be returned.

        The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate
        endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete
        the MFA step and acquire a full member session.

        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will
        be ignored.


        If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will
        not be required to complete an MFA step.'

        This endpoint adapts to your Project''s password strength configuration.

        If you''re using [zxcvbn](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy),
        the default, your passwords are considered valid

        if the strength score is >= 3. If you''re using [LUDS](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passwords/strength-policy),
        your passwords are

        considered valid if they meet the requirements that you''ve set with Stytch.

        You may update your password strength configuration on the [Passwords Policy
        page](https://stytch.com/dashboard/password-strength-config) in the Stytch
        Dashboard.


        If the Member is required to complete MFA to log in to the Organization, the
        returned value of `member_authenticated` will be `false`, and an `intermediate_session_token`
        will be returned.

        The `intermediate_session_token` can be passed into the [OTP SMS Authenticate
        endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/api/authenticate-otp-sms) to complete
        the MFA step and acquire a full member session.

        The `session_duration_minutes` and `session_custom_claims` parameters will
        be ignored.


        If a valid `session_token` or `session_jwt` is passed in, the Member will
        not be required to complete an MFA step.


        Note that a successful password reset via an existing password will revoke
        all active sessions for the `member_id`.'

      description: 'Authenticate an email/password combination in the discovery flow.
        This authenticate flow is only valid for cross-org passwords use cases, and
        is not tied to a specific organization.


        If you have breach detection during authentication enabled in your [password
        strength policy](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/passwords/strength-policy)
        and the member''s credentials have appeared in the HaveIBeenPwned dataset,
        this endpoint will return a `member_reset_password` error even if the member
        enters a correct password. We force a password reset in this case to ensure
        that the member is the legitimate owner of the email address and not a malicious
        actor abusing the compromised credentials.


        If successful, this endpoint will create a new intermediate session and return
        a list of discovered organizations that can be session exchanged into.'

      description: 'Generate an OAuth Attach Token to pre-associate an OAuth flow
        with an existing Stytch User. Pass the returned `oauth_attach_token` to the
        same provider''s OAuth Start endpoint to treat this OAuth flow as a login
        for that user instead of a signup for a new user.


        Exactly one of `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` must be provided
        to identify the target Stytch User.


        **Note**: This is an optional step in the OAuth flow. Stytch can often determine
        whether to associate a new OAuth login with an existing User based on verified
        information (such as an email address) from the identity provider. This endpoint
        is useful for cases where we can''t, such as missing or unverified provider
        information.

      description: 'Send a one-time passcode (OTP) to a user''s phone number. If you''d
        like to create a user and send them a passcode with one request, use our [log
        in or create](https://stytch.com/docs/api/log-in-or-create-user-by-sms) endpoint.


        Note that sending another OTP code before the first has expired will invalidate
        the first code.


        ### Cost to send SMS OTP

        Before configuring SMS or WhatsApp OTPs, please review how Stytch [bills the
        costs of international OTPs](https://stytch.com/pricing) and understand how
        to protect your app against [toll fraud](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/toll-fraud/overview).


        __Note:__ SMS to phone numbers outside of the US and Canada is disabled by
        default for customers who did not use SMS prior to October 2023. If you''re
        interested in sending international SMS, please add those countries to your
        Project''s allowlist via the [Dashboard](https://stytch.com/dashboard/country-code-allowlists)
        or [Programmatic Workspace Actions](https://stytch.com/docs/workspace-management/pwa/set-allowed-country-codes),
        and [add credit card details](https://stytch.com/dashboard/settings/billing)
        to your account.


        Even when international SMS is enabled, we do not support sending SMS to countries
        on our [Unsupported countries list](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/passcodes/unsupported-countries).


        ### Add a phone number to an existing user


        This endpoint also allows you to add a new phone number to an existing Stytch
        User. Including a `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send
        one-time passcode by SMS request will add the new, unverified phone number
        to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates within
        5 minutes, the new phone number will be marked as verified and remain permanently
        on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object,
        and any subsequent login requests using that phone number will create a new
        User.


        ### Next steps


        Collect the OTP which was delivered to the user. Call [Authenticate OTP](https://stytch.com/docs/api/authenticate-otp)

        our [log in or create endpoint](https://stytch.com/docs/api/log-in-or-create-user-by-email-otp).


        ### Add an email to an existing user

        This endpoint also allows you to add a new email address to an existing Stytch
        User. Including a `user_id`, `session_token`, or `session_jwt` in your Send
        one-time passcode by email request will add the new, unverified email address
        to the existing Stytch User. If the user successfully authenticates within
        5 minutes, the new email address will be marked as verified and remain permanently
        on the existing Stytch User. Otherwise, it will be removed from the User object,
        and any subsequent login requests using that email address will create a new
        User.
